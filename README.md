# Reverse_Array_CPP
C++ program to reverse an array elements.
Suppose we have an array with n different elements. We shall have to reverse the elements present in the array and display them. (Do not print them in reverse order, reverse elements in place).

So, if the input is like n = 9 arr = [2,5,6,4,7,8,3,6,4], then the output will be [4,6,3,8,7,4,6,5,2]
